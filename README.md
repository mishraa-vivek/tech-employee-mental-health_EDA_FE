## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores a dataset focused on the **mental health of tech employees**, using data from Kaggle. The primary goal is to understand what factors influence whether a person **seeks treatment** for mental health challenges.

---

## 🔍 The project involves:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Univariate, bivariate & multuivariate analysis of features
- Outlier detection and treatment (Age)
- Categorical data cleaning (Gender, Country)
- Feature transformation (e.g., US vs Non-US country)
- Target variable preparation for modeling (treatment column)
- Plans for Machine Learning Modeling (upcoming)

## 💼 Purpose

This project is built as part of my **Data Analyst portfolio** to demonstrate real-world data handling, storytelling, and preparation for predictive analytics. It serves both as a **personal learning journey** and a showcase of my **analytical skills**

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is taken from Kaggle:  
**[OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)**

The dataset includes survey responses from individuals in the tech industry on their experiences with mental health and treatment.
